# Second-Capstone-Project-Python

In this poject a game was created where enemies move towards your character and if your character hit the enemies you would lose and if not you would win.

- Used a game template that was given in which i had to code more movement controls for the character so it can avoid the enemies which are moving from the right of the screen to the left.
- had to include up and down movement
- intialy there was only one enemy, i had to add 2 more and a prize element that when hit , the game would end.
- if you hit the prize or the enemies are avoided successfully , you win the game.
